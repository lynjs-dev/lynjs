**⚠️ Currently, the API is not public.**
This package is an **initial skeleton** intended to serve as the root of the monorepo and establish distribution channels and a name.

- JS Transpilation/Bundling: No
- JS Files: None currently (public API will be provided in a future phase)
- TypeScript: Type Configurator in progress

The following will be added in future versions:
- Public API (`import { LynElement } from 'lynjs'`)
- Declaration file (types) and documentation
