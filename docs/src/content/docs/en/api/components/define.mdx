title: Define custom element
---

import CodeBlock from '~/components/CodeBlock.astro';

In LynJS, custom elements are defined by extending `LynElement`.

Once defined, the class is registered with the browser's **Custom Elements Registry** and works as a standard Web
Component.

This approach keeps components standard-compliant and makes them easily reusable across different projects.

<CodeBlock
  sources={['/src/examples/api/components/define/define.ts']}
  preview="/src/examples/api/components/define/define.html"
/>

- `LynElement` is the base class that provides lifecycle, rendering, and fine-grained reactivity features.
- `customElements.define` registers the class as a custom element in the browser.
